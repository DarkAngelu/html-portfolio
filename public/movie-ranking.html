<h1>The Best Romantic Comedy (RomCom) Animes of DarkAngelu!</h1>
<h3>"These are the top 3 animes I rank according to my knowledge in these 16 years of anime"</h2>
<hr />
<h2>3. The Quintessentials Quintuplets / Horimiya / Darling in the Franxx</h2>
<h4>- (i) This a quite nice borderline-harem RomCom of a boy and five twin sisters. 
This made up in my list because of the way the storyline is constructed. Due to its Complexity and the genre, it could've gone South
at any moment, but it didn't. Sadly it's been concluded, so kinda sad about that. <br />
(ii) I'd tag this one as a starter for anyone who's trying to start watching RomCom. Quite a nice Storyline, no extra cheesy scenes,
or such over-explicit lovey-dovey couple things. This is definitely a nice starter anime for RomCom. <br />
(iii) Darling in the Franxx is in one word - MP i.e. Masterpiece!! Back in 2013-2016, this was such a trending anime,
man I'm getting Nostalgic now. </h4>
<h2>2. Suzume</h2>
<h4>- Released in 2023 worldwide, directed by Makoto Shinkai, takes one hell of an imagination to make something like that! Man its 
definitely a MUST-TRY!! Your Name, Weathering with you, A garden of words..... it surpasses everyone of them, even though they all 
are made by the same director LoL.
</h4>
<h2>1. Your Lie in April</h2>
<h4>- Man, this still tears me up to this day!! Even though I've achieved the power of restrain my tears and wear a poker face... 
I'm still not able to resist the urge of tearing up and crying while watching this anime!
